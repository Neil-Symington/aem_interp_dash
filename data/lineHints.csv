SURVEY_LINE,Hint,Explanation
1018001,Start with the borehole data and then focus on the broad geometry of the subsurface.,The conductivity section suggests the geology is rather flat and that the three sedimentary units intersected at the borehole are resolvable. Thus we interpret assuming a three layer model. Basement was not picked as we do not have a good handle on where the base of the Grimes siltstone is.
1020001,AEM loses resolution at depth…. boreholes not so much.,"In this section, the top of the Grimes siltstone in the deeper bore does not line up with the conductivity boundary. As boreholes are more reliable, we use them to interpret the depth and then use the AEM to interpret the gradient. In the right hand side of the section, the Cotchin clay is juxtaposed against the Grimes formation. As these units have different ages we can interpret a fault between them at ~13,000m along the section. Since we don't know the thickness of the Cotchin clay, we cannot interpret its base with confidence."
1022002,The geometry of the aircraft relative to the ground often varies in areas with topography.,"In this section the geology looks rather flat. The key pitfall to avoid was over interpretation, especially in the west of the section where there is high frequency variation in the conductivity. This variation could be due to a number of reasons including system geometry, variation in the conductitivity of the clay or the thickness of the sandstone. The best apporach is to use the simplest model which assumes a relatively constant thickness of the Cotchin clay. As we don't know the thickness of the Prestia sandstone, be cannot interpret its base with confidence."
1030002,The AEM inversion displayed here assumes layers are laterally continuous.,"This section has numerous pant leg type artefacts which indicate the conductivity is not layer cake. However, the geology does look quite flat with the exception of the areas with high conductivity in the near surface. Thus our model is the simplest explanation, that the Cotchin clay and Prestia sandstone have a relatively constant thickness and that discontinuous zones of high conductivity of the clay are the cause of the 3D effects. This might be caused by variation in lithology or volume of saline groundwater or both."
1037001,AEM is very good at imaging conductors… resistors not so much.,There is really not enough information here to interpret any interfaces with confidence. The sandstone's interface above the granite is difficult to follow away from the bore due to the resisitivity of the two units. We might infer that the sandstone is underneath the conductive sands in the middle of the section but without more information it is a stab in the dark. Sometimes no interpretation is the best option.
1066001,Data from areas of structural complexity are often difficult to fit with 1D inversions.,"In this section, based on the borehole infromation it appears like the Cotchin clay and the Prestia sadnstone interface is well resolved in the east and west. However, in the centre there are some unlikely geometries and the data has not been fit adequately. Thus we have not interepted anything from ~5,000 to 9,000m along the section. "
2036001,Boreholes and AEM models typically have very different vertical resolution.,"In this section we have relatively conductive material overlying a weathered granite. The morphology of the conductor looks like a palaeochannel and I am thus happy to interpret the base of the channel as being the top of the basement granite. However, there is not sufficient resolution and/ or contrast to resolve the contents of the palaeochannel and so we avoid interpreting the top of Prestia sandstone."
3044002,AEM is a rather good tool for imagin palaeovalley systems in resistive terrains….. Be brave!,"In this section, the AEM has once again resolved a palaeochannel sitting above resistive basement. In this example we are confident enough in interpreting not only the base of the palaeochannel but also two sedimentary units within the palaeovalley fill. The key to interpreting this fill is that the Prestia sandstone is actually more resistive than the Cotchin clay, possibly due to elevated groundwater salinity. It is easy to tacitly assume conductors are clays, but we need to keep an open mind and check all ancillary data."
3045002,High conductivities in the near surface attenuate AEM signal rapidly,"The challenge with this section is that the middle part of the section is so conductive (probably due to saline groundwater) that it masks everything underneath it. Thus we do not interpret anything in this area. However, on the either side of the feature, the geology looks reasonably flat and even consistent from west to east. Thus we interpret the top of the Cotchin clay, Prestia sandstone and Grimes siltstone with confidence."
3046002,AEM excels in areas with layer cake geometry,This section is rather simple except for the apparent discontinuity at ~9500 m along the line and we can interpret stratigrpahy along the contrasts away from the bore. The feature at 9500 m along the line could be a fault offsetting both conductors. However the geometry of the top of the Grimes siltstone is obscured by the discontinuity in the overlying clay and we cannot say for sure if this offset is real or an artefact of inversion.
3053001,Depth of investigation is highly sensitive to the conductivity of the near surface,"The key to interpreting this section is to consider that just because a conductor disappears, it might not mean that it doesn't exist. In this case we have borehole evidence the Grimes siltstone continues underneath the Cotchin clay and its disapearance can be explained by an increase in the conductivity and thickness of the overburden increasing. Otherwise this section seems to show a rather simple, gently dipping stratigraphy."
4043001,You've got this.,"Once again, this AEM section resolves a palaeochannel sitting above granitic basement. The key to interpreting this section is to avoid interpreting in areas with high misfits and where there is no information. Otherwise the palaeochannel is well resolved and the different stratigraphy within the fill is consistent with the borehole."
